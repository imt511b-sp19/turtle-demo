    Concept for drawing tick marks, final version will likely have more arguments
    This simple version is hard-coded to jump up by 10 each time.
    A good version would:
    - start at 0 on the x axis
    - start at a point on the y axis derived from the maximum height and the tick number (1...n)
        - perhaps 'tick_num' is an input?
        - y_max would not be necessary, start at 0 and use the global WINDOW_HEIGHT to determine the limit
    - also write a tick label/value
